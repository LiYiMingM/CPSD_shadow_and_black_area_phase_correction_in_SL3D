## Introduction

- Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) faces challenges in measuring unsatisfactory intensity modulation areas, especially shadow and black areas, causing pseudo phases and obvious nonlinear calibration error in 3D measurement. To address these issues, we proposed a cyclic phase-shifts difference (CPSD) module based on phase-shifting gratings. CPSD uses double layer circulation to retain the pixels with higher light intensity and finally create a mask that removes black and shadow areas. Removing the necessity for further post-processing or projection in phase adjustment, we achieved the global phase accuracy enhancement and high-precision 3D point clouds without pseudo points. The methodâ€™s efficacy was proven through experiments on three calibration planes, achieving a significant reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) and standard deviation (STD) in plane reconstruction (up to 50.9% and 56.1% respectively). We believe CPSD has potential for wide application across various FPP related fields.
